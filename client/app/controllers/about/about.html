      <p>ShareAustin is an application with the intent to bring people together while getting more value out of our neglected belongings. Why not pull that old kayak out of the garage to share with a neighbor? Austin is a city well-known for its recreational ventures, and ShareAustin aims to make these fun, outdoor ventures readily available to those who don't have the means or storage to house every single tool needed to go camping, kayaking, or even rock climbing.</p>
