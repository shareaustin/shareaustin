# ShareAustin

ShareAustin provides a place where a community can find and provide hard to rent items -- like a kayak, a parking spot, or a guitar amp -- quickly and easily. Filtered searches and detailed listings for each rental provide photos, a description, when the item is available, and the renter's history. Integration with the Stripe API makes payments quick, safe, and secure. Have a question about a rental? Chat with the renter from within the app. Finally, everyone is held accountable through a mutual rating / review system that updates after every transaction.
